The Space Pirates were then able to get a call out for reinforcement. Another cruiser and 2 small small fighters.

Alune left the cockpit to fight off the robots swarming the ship, killing them by the dozens.

Cole, Faye, and Tarrow worked together to destroy the remaining Pirate vessels, though taking heavy damage to the ship in the process.

The woman , introducing herself as Amandi, offers to pay for upgrades to the group’s ship if they agree to hunt down some local pirates. The group decides upgrading their ship is the only way to not die in space.

While the ship is being upgraded, Alune and Cole explore Gastrea Station. They find specialty audio equipment and recording devices and Alune is pumped.

Randy goes to oversee the repairs (and to make sure Magus doesn’t eat anybody). He ends up grilling Cole and Alune about letting him sell his eye to Amandi.

Left unsupervised, Amandi and Faye steal a cheetah’s Tail from the zoo. The party is forced to make a panicked get away from Gastrea Station.

A couple days pass while the group travels to a system near Astra to hunt for pirates.

A series of Mysterious Mines force the party off the main Hyper Lane.

The group engages space pirates, 2 Large Cruisers.

After Blowing up one of the ships, the group accidently wandered into an enemy mine and their ship was swarmed with small Robots

The group finally reaches Gastrea Station. 

Upon landing, RAT tests a new spell to help defend the ship (and hopefully solve his loneliness problem), but ends up accidently summoning a [[Glossaries/Catalogue of Monsters#Deep Hunter\|Deep Hunter]], a Huge Lava Shark from [[Lore/Previous Games/TerraMors\|TerraMors]]. RAT decides to name it Magus.

Gastrea Station turns out to be a large space station owned by the Galactic Federal Authority where many travelers dock. It features many official Government buildings, along with a full zoo.

The crew needs gas, but discovers their left over money from floor 1 is worthless, and they’ll need to get Galactic Forces Coinage from the Department of Commerce in order to get the fuel they need to get to Astra.

The group heads to the Department of Commerce building where they discover a strange empty line. They decide to wait into this line and are brought into the office of a mysterious woman working for the GFA. 

At first the mysterious woman buys the Ore and Robot parts (and RAT’s eye) from the party to get them the necessary fuel for their journey, however she takes a special interest in the parties strange behaviors and final destination, and offers to help them get to Astra.

It turns out Astra station has started a rebellion against the GFA and no one is allowed in or out, however the woman says she can get the party past the blockade, if they bring her with and help her track down some special artifacts. She also hires on RAT to be her personal Bodyguard.
