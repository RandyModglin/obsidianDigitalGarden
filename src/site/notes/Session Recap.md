Battle with the strange creatures known as Ravengers began. During the battle, Tarrow recklessly rushed into the enemy and was promptly killed. During the combat Cole received a gift from Ara, a goblet containing a permanently burning flame.

After the rest of the group defeated the beasts, they were able to revive Randy, and the group set out to explore the ruins they had found beneath the Pirate Stronghold.

Many of the buildings appeared old and abandoned, but after some searching, the group found a Magic Trapdoor built into one of the buildings. After destroying it, the group found a basement that appeared as dusty and decrepit as the rest of the ruins, but with dustless camping equipment set up within.

Venturing deeper in the basement, the group found a suspicious wall containing bricks, each engraved with the symbol of a different god. After some brute force puzzle solving, the group rearranged the engraved bricks: 
1. [[Characters/Gods/Three Hopes#Delon\|Delon]] 
2. Nepoti
3. An Unknown symbol depicting 2 eyes 
4. Another Unknown symbol depicting  a circle with a pair of wings in the center and a scythe running through)
causing a hidden door to open up.

After following it, the door led to a tunnel running directly under the Pirate’s Stronghold. As the group was formulating a plan of attack, a massive hoard of Ravengers burst through the tunnel and into the pirate stronghold.

In the ensuing chaos, the group ran through the base and found a large elaborate door.

After defeating the last of the pirates, the group split up around the ship to handle the aftermath.
- Tarrow used the Vduck’s nets to collect Wreckage from the destroyed ships, collecting many lost souls.
- Amandi offered Faye some upgrades to improve her combat effectiveness, including giving her Tarrow’s eye.
- Alune and Cole spoke in private about more of her concerning visions from their shared deity, [[Characters/Gods/Domain Gods/Life Domain Gods#Ara\|Ara]].

After regrouping, the crew set out towards the Pirate’s base to find the relic Amandi sought. Tarrow, Faye, and Cole sat in the cockpit discussing Tarrow’s history before joining the group, meanwhile Elfie and Ashley split off to repair the ship.

Finally, the group reached a small dessert planet the pirates called home, a massive Metal Structure built into a Canyon. The outside was heavily fortified, so the group tunneled under ground, hoping to breach the compound from below.

However, underneath the pirate base was a massive cave with a ruin. In the otheworld, Cole saw the Shadow People the group saw on floor 1 looking for something in the ruin. However in the real world, the group was attacked by strange creatures.

The Space Pirates were then able to get a call out for reinforcement. Another cruiser and 2 small small fighters.

Alune left the cockpit to fight off the robots swarming the ship, killing them by the dozens.

Cole, Faye, and Tarrow worked together to destroy the remaining Pirate vessels, though taking heavy damage to the ship in the process.

## 1/14/25
The woman , introducing herself as Amandi, offers to pay for upgrades to the group’s ship if they agree to hunt down some local pirates. The group decides upgrading their ship is the only way to not die in space.

While the ship is being upgraded, Alune and Cole explore Gastrea Station. They find specialty audio equipment and recording devices and Alune is pumped.

Randy goes to oversee the repairs (and to make sure Magus doesn’t eat anybody). He ends up grilling Cole and Alune about letting him sell his eye to Amandi. Alune takes this really hard, locking herself in her quarters for several days.

Left unsupervised, Amandi and Faye steal a cheetah’s Tail from the zoo. The party is forced to make a panicked get away from Gastrea Station.

A couple days pass while the group travels to a system near Astra to hunt for pirates.

A series of Mysterious Mines force the party off the main Hyper Lane.

The group engages space pirates, 2 Large Cruisers.

After Blowing up one of the ships, the group accidently wandered into an enemy mine and their ship was swarmed with small Robots

The group finally reaches Gastrea Station. 

Upon landing, RAT tests a new spell to help defend the ship (and hopefully solve his loneliness problem), but ends up accidently summoning a [[Glossaries/Catalogue of Monsters#Deep Hunter\|Deep Hunter]], a Huge Lava Shark from [[Lore/Previous Games/TerraMors\|TerraMors]]. RAT decides to name it Magus.

Gastrea Station turns out to be a large space station owned by the Galactic Federal Authority where many travelers dock. It features many official Government buildings, along with a full zoo.

The crew needs gas, but discovers their left over money from floor 1 is worthless, and they’ll need to get Galactic Forces Coinage from the Department of Commerce in order to get the fuel they need to get to Astra.

The group heads to the Department of Commerce building where they discover a strange empty line. They decide to wait into this line and are brought into the office of a mysterious woman working for the GFA. 

At first the mysterious woman buys the Ore and Robot parts (and RAT’s eye) from the party to get them the necessary fuel for their journey, however she takes a special interest in the parties strange behaviors and final destination, and offers to help them get to Astra.

It turns out Astra station has started a rebellion against the GFA and no one is allowed in or out, however the woman says she can get the party past the blockade, if they bring her with and help her track down some special artifacts. She also hires on RAT (and later Faye) to be her personal Bodyguards.

Despite the recent fiasco, RAT is entrusted by the group to travel with the woman to get the ship’s fuel. A test to make sure he can be alone without transforming.

## 1/2/25
Cole and Alune are discussing a disturbing revelation given to Cole by [[Characters/Gods/Domain Gods/Life Domain Gods#Ara\|Ara]]. She informed him that when they had traveled from floor 1 to floor 3, half of RAT’s soul had been torn away and formed a full new soul that they had left behind on Floor 1. He also learned that time passes very differently between the floors, with potentially years having already passed since they’d been gone.

Just as they make a plan of what to do, the Vduck falls out of the hyperlane, and a voice comes over the ship’s intercom.

The 4th Soul inside RAT’s body had taken over after they were left alone in the cockpit. It attempted to strand the group in deep space, and had filled the cockpit with bombs that would destroy the ship and themselves if anyone attempted to get them back on track.

He claimed it was unfair that the group had left him to sit inside his Soul Crystal after the operation that created RAT on floor 1, and now he would get even by making the group drift through deep space.

Faye offered to beat the snot out of the 4th soul for pulling a stunt like this, positing they could likely find a way around the bombs and looking to protect their new-born child.

Alune attempted to reason with the Soul, trying to apologize and empathize, but this only made them angrier.

Finally, the group decided to tell the Soul about it’s floor 1 counterpart, and it agreed to let them go in return for them all going to floor 1 to make right what they did. The soul passes out.

RAT reawakens later, offering his full apologies to every member of the group.
