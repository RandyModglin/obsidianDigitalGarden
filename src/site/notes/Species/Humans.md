# Humans

## Culture
The most adaptable of the races that call [[Locations/The Home\|The Home]] their home, choosing to work as generalists capable of specializing in any field. This has allowed humans the ability to spread far and wide, capable of surviving in a wide number of environments.

In addition to their adaptivity, humans are also incredibly empathetic creatures, affording them strong relation ships with other races, including the gods.

## Society
The largest human society is an empire lead by twin queens, [[Alexia and Amber\|Alexia and Amber]]. 

It is of note that the largest human civilization was functionally founded by [[Characters/Gods/Other Gods#Aurora\|Aurora]] a daughter of the goddess [[Characters/Gods/Seven Lights#Mori\|Mori]], though humans as a whole had existed before [[Characters/Gods/Other Gods#Aurora\|Aurora’s]] arrival.

## Diplomacy
