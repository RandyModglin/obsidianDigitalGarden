### Boarding Crew
Launch from ship

Move the small ship based on it’s speed

Do Turret Crew Actions aboard small ship

### Communications
Attempts to hack into enemy ships:
Make a Roll to shut down a system on target ship, choosing based on what DC’s you beat. Things can be fixed by navigator/engineer.
- Life support (needs to make repair checks until working again) : 25 
- Engines (can not move until fixed): 15
- Turrets (cannot use until fixed): 18 
- Missiles (cannot use until fixed): 18
- Communications (cannot coordinate with other ships or give messages to other ships. Until fixed): 18
- Shields (lose access to DR from shields until fixed): 15
- Other (if you come up with something cool) 

Defend from enemy hacks:
 To fix or prevent, make the same checks as above

Use Comms
### Engineer
Can make a check to boost Shields (10+= 5 DR, 15+= 10 DR, 20+ = 15 DR….etc)

Repairs (Dc 15, heals 2d20) 

Boost to engine add + 2 squares

Defend from enemy hacks:
 To fix or prevent, make the same checks as seen in Communications

### Gunner
Fire guns from ship:
X Attacks (based on ship), different ranges require different DC. The ships guns start facing forwards and have to be repositioned if wanting to be shot in a different direction. Defense use is 360 around the ship. 
	x<= 3 : 5+ 
	3<x<= 5 : 10+ 
	5< x <= 10 : 15+
	10 < x : 20+

### Pilot
Can Move the ship based on the ship’s movement speed.

Can attempt a maneuver:
- Barrel Roll: Extra 2 movement but may cause crew members to lose an action roll 5 or less
- Spinning: 10 to DR but may cause crew members to lose an action on a roll 10 or less
- Flip Around: May cause crew members to lose an action roll 5 or less
- Fire flares: Adds 4 to shooting down missiles rolls

Fire missiles:
	Roll xd20, x being the ships missile count.
	Missiles lose 10 damage for every 5ft they travel
