The original home of the [[Characters/Gods/Seven Lights\|Seven Lights]]

---
# Description
Made from the body of the [[Characters/Gods/Primal Entities#Mikasu\|Primal Entity Mikasu]] as a home for her creation the [[Characters/Gods/Seven Lights\|Seven Lights]] to protect them from the wrath of her brother [[Characters/Gods/Primal Entities#Maynel\|Maynel]]. It is unclear if the act of becoming [[Locations/The Home\|Home]] killed [[Characters/Gods/Primal Entities#Mikasu\|Mikasu]], or if she somehow lives on in this state.

Also of note, it would appear that somehow [[Locations/The Home\|The Home]] offers some level of protection to it's inhabitants from forces beyond [[Locations/The Home\|Home]]. No harm comes to [[Characters/Gods/Seven Lights#Mainell\|Mainell]] until he leaves the boundaries of home, and the [[Characters/Gods/The Nine\|voice from beyond home]] was unable to enter until invited in by [[Characters/Gods/Seven Lights#Mori\|Mori]].
