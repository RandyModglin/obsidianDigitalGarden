### Gigantes Spike
Home Rules: None

Notation: Mt-Sp-xhx-Ae-Ci-xhx
Formula: [[Spells/Pure Types/Metal/Metal\|Metal]]-Spike-30-Area-Circle-30

Spell Effect: ***Lingering***
The user creates a 30ft tall metal spike in the center of a 30ft circle. Creatures  in the area make a Dexterity Save against you [[Glossaries/System Glossary#Spell DC\|Spell DC]] + 5x ( x being each square to the closest edge of the circle). 

On a successful save, the creature is able to move to the nearest square outside the circle. 

On a failed save, the creature takes 5 damage per square they move through until they land on the nearest square outside the circle. 

If the creature fails and is in the center, make a Constitution Save against you [[Glossaries/System Glossary#Spell DC\|Spell DC]], on a fail, the creature is impaled by the spike taking 30d6 Piercing Damage and gains [[Glossaries/Conditions Glossary#Bleed X\|Bleed 10]]. If the creature is still alive, it needs a Strength Check of 30 to pull itself off the spikes and slide down to a square outside the circle.
