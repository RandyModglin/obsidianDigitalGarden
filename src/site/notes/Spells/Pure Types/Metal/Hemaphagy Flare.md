Home Rules: None

Notation: Mt-Ml-Pa-Ae-Ci-x0x-Dm-xt-Ma-Hy-Ml-Bu-Ae-Ci-x0x-Dm-xt 
Formula: [[Spells/Pure Types/Metal/Metal\|Metal]]-Enhancement-[[Blood\|Blood]]-Area-Circle-10-Damage-2-Combine-Fire-Enhancement-Burn-Area-Circle-10-Damage-2

Spell Effect:
Creatures with blood in the area make a Constitution Save against your [[Misc/Glossaries/System Glossary#Spell DC\|Spell DC]], those that fail have the iron in the blood to bind together to form little flowing blades in the blood stream, taking 2d6 Unmitigated Slashing Damage and gaining [[Misc/Glossaries/Conditions Glossary#Bleed X\|Bleed 2]]. For every 5 under the save, the creature increases their Bleed value by 1. 

The spell will also cause affected creatures to take half the Slashing Damage as Fire Damage and become [[Misc/Glossaries/Conditions Glossary#Burn\|Burned]] and [[Misc/Glossaries/Conditions Glossary#Combust\|Combustible]]. If the Combustion would cause Burn again, the creature will have its Bleed value increase by every point of damage over 30 damage the Combustion does.

Cooldown:
Fire (11): Damage (2) + Condition (3) + Enhancement (1) + Combine (5) - Wis Mod
Metal (11): Damage (2) + Condition (3) + Enhancement (1) + Combine (5) - Wis Mod
