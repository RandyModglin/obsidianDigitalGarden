### Inflict Rebellion
Home Rules: None

Spell Focus: [[Monarchy\|Monarchy]] - (Au)
Notation: Ta-Si-In-Tg-By 
Formula: [[Spells/Pure Types/Life/Life\|Life]]-Freedom-Increase-Target-Body

Spell Effect:
User attempts to free a target from their loyalty to their Monarch. The user makes an Intelligence check against the Targets [[Glossaries/System Glossary#Spell DC\|Spell DC]] . 

If the user succeeds then the target is unbound to the monarch they followed, and has no allegiances. This effect will remain in place as long as the user keeps the spell running or until the target makes a Intelligence Save against the userâ€™s [[Glossaries/System Glossary#Spell DC\|Spell DC]] at the end of their turn, excluding the first under the influence of the spell. 

Depending on the loyalty of the target, the target may once again be loyal to the monarch after the effect, or lose interest in that said monarchy.

Cooldown:
Life (2): Conditions (1) + Targets(1) - Cha Mod - Wis Mod
