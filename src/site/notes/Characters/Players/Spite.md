## Test of Spirit
Randy’s Answers to the Test of Spirit given before the start of the game:

### The Tunnel
**You awake in a dark tunnel, with no knowledge of how you got there. In one direction the tunnel continues, in the other, there’s a bright light. What do you do?**
	I need to get my bearings and find a way out of this tunnel, I’ll head towards the light.
	
**In the light you see three doors, one blue, one green, and one pink. What do you do?**
	One of these doors might kill me, but I’m more worried about what could be in this tunnel, I’m gonna risk it with a door.
	Green feels like it represents the color that I think is the least likely to kill me painfully.
	
**As you enter through the Green Door, you see 3 podiums, each with an item. A stick, a Rock, and a Pocket Watch. What do you do?**
	I’ll pick up and examine the pocket watch.
