9 [[Glossaries/Lore Glossary#Light\|Lights]] that used to be one mysterious voice that lived in the darkness beyond [[Locations/The Home\|Home]]. 

---
# Details
After the death of the god [[Characters/Gods/Seven Lights#Mainell\|Mainell]], the [[Characters/Gods/Seven Lights\|Seven Lights]] were searching for a way to create new [[Glossaries/Lore Glossary#Light\|Lights]]. This is when the Goddess [[Characters/Gods/Seven Lights#Mori\|Mori]] began conversing with a mysterious voice from beyond [[Locations/The Home\|Home]]. In return for teaching [[Characters/Gods/Seven Lights#Mori\|Mori]] how to create [[Glossaries/Lore Glossary#Light\|Light]], she agrees to let the voice into [[Locations/The Home\|Home]]. Upon entering, the voice split into Nine [[Glossaries/Lore Glossary#Light\|Lights]] and scattered across the land. 

While the reason is unknown, these 9 appear to be the 9 original [[Lore/Previous Games/TerraMors\|TerraMors]] Gods, powerful and cruel gods from before [[Locations/The Home\|The Home]]‘s creation. Originally characters in Dungeon and Dragons Games, they appear to have been somehow made manifest.

Based on the description given of the 9, it would appear that they have retained memories of the events from their previous iterations. With [[Characters/Gods/The Nine\|Sin]] making a reference to the original [[Lore/Previous Games/TowerMors\|TowerMors]] game. 

Of interest, despite their often antagonistic role in both [[Lore/Previous Games/TerraMors\|TerraMors]] and the original [[Lore/Previous Games/TowerMors\|TowerMors]], their role in [[Lore/History/The Creation\|the story of creation]] paints them in a much more positive light. Though their given descriptions do not promote this narrative.

Lastly, it is also important to remember that, while they are referred to as gods, this classification isn’t entirely correct. Like the 3 [[Characters/Gods/Primal Entities\|Primal Entities]], they are a sort of strange elevated being that defies classic definition.
