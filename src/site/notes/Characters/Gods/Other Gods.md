## Created by [[Characters/Gods/Seven Lights#Mainell\|Mainell]]

### Clain
God of weather and one of the gods created by [[Characters/Gods/Seven Lights#Mainell\|Mainell]]. He was created to help maintain the balance between the gods and to cater to their needs.

### Hike
God of Knowledge and one of the gods created by [[Characters/Gods/Seven Lights#Mainell\|Mainell]]. He was created to find and seek knowledge wherever it may be found.

Over many years, Hike has come to be a librarian of historical events and a scholar of research covering all sorts of topics. Often times stepping in to settle arguments between gods.

### Demi and Phoebe
The Twin Goddesses of Change and a pair of gods created by [[Characters/Gods/Seven Lights#Mainell\|Mainell]]. They were created to ensure things never remain the same, even each other. They love to create new things or make old things new. Always testing new and different ways to make things. 

It is of note that these two are characters with significance outside of the world of towers, appearing as NPCs in [[Lore/Previous Games/TerraMors\|TerraMors]], as adopted children of one of the players [[Characters/Players/Randy/Randy\|Randy]]. Give that the plot of [[Lore/Previous Games/TowerMors\|TowerMors]] centered on the idea of [[Characters/Players/Michael\|Michael]] and his friends being transported to a fantasy world he had created, as well as the appearance of other [[Lore/Previous Games/TerraMors\|TerraMors]] characters such as [[Characters/Gods/The Nine\|The Nine]], it is unclear how they came to be.

## Unknown Origins

### Helma
A goddess of currently unknown origins, she was killed by the monarchs of the [[Species/Ice Elves\|Mycanil]] people, [[Nira and Tellem\|Nira and Tellem]], at their wedding in an event known as the [[Shattering of Helma\|Shattering of Helma]].

It is unclear what exactly she was a god of, though in the story it is said her body exuded ’“Radiant Heat”, leading to the assumption that she may be related to the god [[Characters/Gods/Seven Lights#Hoyi\|Hoyi]].

## Contentious Gods

### Aurora
Daughter of the goddess [[Characters/Gods/Seven Lights#Mori\|Mori]], it is unclear if they are really a god or not, but they did play a key role in the [[Lore/History/The Birth of the Empire\|founding of the Human Empire]].
