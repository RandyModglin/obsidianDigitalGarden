Gods created by the goddess [[Characters/Gods/Seven Lights#Gria\|Gria]] that help rule over those that live on the ground.
- - -
# Details
Three gods created by the goddess of the ground [[Characters/Gods/Seven Lights#Gria\|Gria]]. Despite being made by the same goddess, the three rarely cooperate or get along. While [[Characters/Gods/Domain Gods/Ground Domain Gods#Marshin\|Marshin]] is more than content to live out a simple life, [[Characters/Gods/Domain Gods/Ground Domain Gods#Nati\|Nati]] and [[Characters/Gods/Domain Gods/Ground Domain Gods#Gorick\|Gorick]] are locked in a constant struggle of Nature VS Animals, constantly vying for superiority. 

As their battle wages on, animals are created to eat and destroy plants, and in kind, plants were created to kill the animals, leading to an unending war of evolution.

# Description

## Nati
Nature’s Beauty and one of the [[Characters/Gods/Domain Gods/Ground Domain Gods\|Ground Gods]]. She came to be after [[Characters/Gods/Seven Lights#Gria\|Gria]] saw a beautiful flower and helped it to grow into a godly form. She is often depicted as a young woman with roses in her hair.

Nati loves all the plants and jungles across [[Locations/The Home\|Home]] and has dedicated herself to protecting the forests and jungles where they grow. This often brings her into conflict with her brother [[Characters/Gods/Domain Gods/Ground Domain Gods#Gorick\|Gorick]], as his animals eat and destroy her precious plants.

## Gorick
The Animal and one of the [[Characters/Gods/Domain Gods/Ground Domain Gods\|Ground Gods]]. As he explored [[Locations/The Home\|Home]] he grew fond of the vast array of creatures that roamed the land and decided he should live like them. He takes the form of many animals, from lions to worms.

Gorick acts more like an animal these days, rejecting all civilization and living by only rule, survival of the fittest. He is constantly in conflict with his sister [[Characters/Gods/Domain Gods/Ground Domain Gods#Nati\|Nati]] to prove his animals are the superior form of life.

## Marshin
The Recycler and one of the [[Characters/Gods/Domain Gods/Ground Domain Gods\|Ground Gods]]. He noticed that all around [[Locations/The Home\|Home]] living things would slowly come to die, their bodies simply lying there undisturbed and unable to be brought back. He couldn’t stand to see these bodies go to waste, and so he set out to return them back into the cycle of life.

He loosed creation all across [[Locations/The Home\|Home]] to scavenge for the dead, break them down, and return their bodies’ nutrients to the environment.

Unlike his siblings, Marshin has no interest in competition or conflict, simply looking to carry out his work to maintain the circle of life.
