- - -
# Details
3 gods all made by the god [[Characters/Gods/Seven Lights#Mitasa\|Mitasa]]. While each were made with good intentions, they have since become more obsessed with their own goals. [[Characters/Gods/Domain Gods/Light Domain Gods#Angith\|Angith]] and [[Characters/Gods/Domain Gods/Light Domain Gods#Galmic\|Galmic]] are both locked in a constant battle to determine which is the true ruler of the heavens. Meanwhile [[Characters/Gods/Domain Gods/Light Domain Gods#Thera\|Thera]] has become a threat to mortal and god alike.

# Description

## Galmic
The Sky King and one of the [[Characters/Gods/Domain Gods/Light Domain Gods\|Light Gods]], Galmic was made to help rule over the skies. He fell in love with the sky so deeply that he began to make creatures with the gift of flight, so that they could share in his joy.

Of all his creations though, his favorite were the [[Dragons\|Dragons]]. Incredibly powerful and majestic creatures, Galmic often takes the form of a [[Dragons\|Dragon]] himself.

Both Galmic and his sister [[Characters/Gods/Domain Gods/Light Domain Gods#Angith\|Angith]] are locked in a constant battle, each seeking to prove themselves and their creations as the true rulers of the heavens.

## Angith
The Angel of Heaven and one of the [[Characters/Gods/Domain Gods/Light Domain Gods\|Light Gods]], she protects [[Characters/Gods/Seven Lights#Mitasa\|Mitasa]] from her kingdom in the clouds along side her creations, the [[Angels\|Angels]].

Angith believed that the best way to ensure [[Characters/Gods/Seven Lights#Mitasa\|Mitasa]]‘s safety was to establish good relationships with the other creatures of [[Locations/The Home\|Home]]. In an effort to achieve this, her creations took on the appearances of other creatures and worked to protect the defenseless and enact justice and valor.

Both Angith and her brother [[Characters/Gods/Domain Gods/Light Domain Gods#Galmic\|Galmic]] are locked in a constant battle, each seeking to prove themselves and their creations as the true rulers of the heavens.

## Thera
The Nightmare and one of the [[Characters/Gods/Domain Gods/Light Domain Gods\|Light Gods]], seeing her creator’s hard work to maintain the lights of [[Locations/The Home\|Home]], she sought to create a time where he could rest. Thus she created the night, during which Thera could watch over the lands in [[Characters/Gods/Seven Lights#Mitasa\|Mitasa]]‘s stead and maintain the lights for all to see.

However, Thera came to notice that creature’s all over the land began to rest at night, and she grew curious. She wanted to know what it was the creature’s she watched over dreamed of, so she entered their minds while they slept.

Sadly, mortal minds were not made to handle the presence of a god, and their dreams made her out to be an invader, a monster. Thera became feared, and after being treated like a monster for so long, she eventually became the monster they all feared.

She has grown to be considered even the fear of the gods.
