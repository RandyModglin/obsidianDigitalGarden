# Detail
3 gods all made by the god [[Characters/Gods/Seven Lights#Hoyi\|Seven Lights#Hoyi]]. While originally made to help [[Characters/Gods/Seven Lights#Hoyi\|Seven Lights#Hoyi]] relax and enjoy the bounties of [[Locations/The Home\|Home]], their constant antics and bickering have ended up creating more work for him then ever. 

# Description

## Hyt
The Goddess of Fire and one of the [[Characters/Gods/Domain Gods/Temperature Domain Gods\|Temperature Gods]]. After feeling the heat brush against her skin for the first time, she fell in love. She wanted to spread her love of heat by raising the temperature higher and higher and higher!

Hyt’s favorite humans were the first to embrace her fire’s warmth to keep warm on cold nights. She’s also quite close with her brother [[Characters/Gods/Domain Gods/Temperature Domain Gods#Teris\|Temperature Domain Gods#Teris]] constantly competing for who can make the greatest heat.

However, her relationship with her other sibling [[Characters/Gods/Domain Gods/Temperature Domain Gods#Myca\|Temperature Domain Gods#Myca]] isn’t quite as positive, as the two often fight over Hot VS Cold.

## Teris
The God of Volcanos and one of the [[Characters/Gods/Domain Gods/Temperature Domain Gods\|Temperature Gods]]. While [[Characters/Gods/Seven Lights#Mitasa\|Seven Lights#Mitasa]]‘s light helped warm much, Teris found the ground far to cold for his liking, and so he decided to heat it up. As the ground become to melt and flow, Teris was captured by its’ beauty. Believing that something so beautiful must be correct state of things, he seeks to make all things just as stunning.

Teris is quite close with his sister [[Characters/Gods/Domain Gods/Temperature Domain Gods#Hyt\|Temperature Domain Gods#Hyt]], with the two often engaging in sibling rivalry, however his relationship with his other sister [[Characters/Gods/Domain Gods/Temperature Domain Gods#Myca\|Temperature Domain Gods#Myca]] is far less positive.

## Myca
The Winter Queen and one of the [[Characters/Gods/Domain Gods/Temperature Domain Gods\|Temperature Gods]]. Myca despised the heat that [[Characters/Gods/Seven Lights#Hoyi\|Seven Lights#Hoyi]] had created, it was too hot and caused creatures all over to overheat and die. So Myca decided she would keep the heat in check, removing it from many places all over [[Locations/The Home\|Home]] and creating entire biomes in wonderful cold. She quickly fell in love with the elegance of her winter wonderlands.

This love of the cold has put Myca at odds with her siblings [[Characters/Gods/Domain Gods/Temperature Domain Gods#Hyt\|Temperature Domain Gods#Hyt]] and [[Characters/Gods/Domain Gods/Temperature Domain Gods#Teris\|Temperature Domain Gods#Teris]]. Though despite her cold exterior, she does have a soft spot for the [[Species/Ice Elves\|Ice Elves]], supporting them in murdering the goddess [[Characters/Gods/Other Gods#Helma\|Other Gods#Helma]].
