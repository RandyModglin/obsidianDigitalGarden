Gods created by the goddess [[Characters/Gods/Seven Lights#Mori\|Mori]] to help watch over the living and make sure no soul goes uncollected.
- - -
# Details
[[Characters/Gods/Seven Lights#Mori\|Mori]] is responsible for supplying and maintaining all life within [[Locations/The Home\|Home]]. Whenever one life ends, its’ soul is taken in and repurposed into a new life. While Mori has no real love for her creations, she sees it as the best way to honor her brother’s sacrifice. To that end, she created three gods to help her perpetuate the cycle.

# Description

## Mehit
The Eyes of Life and one of the [[Characters/Gods/Domain Gods/Life Domain Gods\|Life Gods]], she watches over all living things, ensuring that no soul gets lost.

She has a strange fondness for owls and often appears as one.

## Ara
The Fate Weaver and one of the [[Characters/Gods/Domain Gods/Life Domain Gods\|Life Gods]], she is an elusive god often depicted as a spider that weaves the webs of fate. Many say that seeing her is a sign of something significant about to happen, and those that worship her often go mad.

It is of note that Ara is a character with significance outside of the world of towers, being the player character of the creator of the original [[Lore/Previous Games/TowerMors\|TowerMors]], [[Characters/Players/Michael\|Michael]], from a different Dungeons and Dragons Game. Given that the plot of [[Lore/Previous Games/TowerMors\|TowerMors]] centered on the idea of [[Characters/Players/Michael\|Michael]] and his friends being transported to a fantasy world he had created, it is unclear if Ara’s appearance here is a coincidence, or a symbol of something greater.

## Hymm
The Hand of Death and one of the [[Characters/Gods/Domain Gods/Life Domain Gods\|Life Gods]], he is responsible for collecting the souls that Mehit see separate from their [[Glossaries/Lore Glossary#Crystal\|Crystal]] and returning them to [[Characters/Gods/Seven Lights#Mori\|Mori]]. Despite the importance of his job however, he’s a bit of a lay about, loving nothing more than doing nothing.

In addition to his normal responsibilities, he also ensures the other gods never kill each other. Though this to is a duty he has no interest in performing.
