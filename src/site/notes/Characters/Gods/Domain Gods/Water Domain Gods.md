# Details
Three sibling all created by the goddess of water [[Characters/Gods/Seven Lights#Lihit\|Lihit]], unlike many of the other gods created by the [[Characters/Gods/Seven Lights\|Seven Lights]], they devoted themselves to working together for a common goal.

Together they lead the armies of the Water Realms to wage war against the inhabitants of [[Locations/The Home\|Home]]. [[Characters/Gods/Domain Gods/Water Domain Gods#Echina\|Echina]] creating powerful and experimental monster, [[Characters/Gods/Domain Gods/Water Domain Gods#Lily\|Lily]] organizing them into her elite army, and [[Characters/Gods/Domain Gods/Water Domain Gods#Milo\|Milo]] enhancing them with his “experiments”.

Unfortunately, while their army may be powerful, when there’s no major sources of water around they quickly dry up, limiting their dreams of conquest. 

# Description
## Echina
One of the [[Characters/Gods/Domain Gods/Water Domain Gods\|Water Gods]] and ruler of the deep oceans. In the dark depths of the oceans, Echina noticed the unique adaptations of the creatures living there, and began taking an interest in making some of her own.

Echina has become a sort of “Mother of Monsters”, making experimental new creatures to lurk in the ocean’s depths, and supplying the Water Realms‘ army with new threats.

## Lily
One of the [[Characters/Gods/Domain Gods/Water Domain Gods\|Water Gods]] and the protector of the swamps and rivers. 

However, she had a vision. A vision of creating the ultimate soldiers capable of fighting on both land and sea. This was the birth of the deadly warrior race, the [[Froggles\|Froggles]].

## Milo
Last of the [[Characters/Gods/Domain Gods/Water Domain Gods\|Water Gods]] created by the goddess, Milo was far more interested in the water stored in the living creatures of the world. He learned to use and manipulate it, taking control of the creatures from both his siblings and their rivals. From there he would modify the creatures to draw out their true potential.

While the three [[Characters/Gods/Domain Gods/Water Domain Gods\|Water Gods]] do have a strong alliance, Milo has shown a much greater interest in moving behind his sisters backs.
