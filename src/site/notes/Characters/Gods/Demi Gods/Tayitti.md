# Tayitti 
The body maker, is a creation of [[Characters/Gods/Domain Gods/Ground Domain Gods#Gorick\|Gorick]]. 

Her purpose is to make better and more unique bodies to overcome many obstacles that those irritating plants impose. Tayitti is not opposed to working on bodies currently existing but they just have the problem of having a soul to work around. However if you find her she seems willing to either modify or make a body for a priceâ€¦
