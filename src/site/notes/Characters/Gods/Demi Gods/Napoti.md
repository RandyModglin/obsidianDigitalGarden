# Napoti
The tree of protection or the murder tree depending on how you view it. 

This tree was made by [[Characters/Gods/Domain Gods/Ground Domain Gods#Nati\|Nati]] to help protect and create new ways for plants to live in this wild world with animals. Napoti, isnâ€™t exactly against animals but rather wants plants to live without being feasted upon or destroyed by animals. This of course makes his views on humanoids very case by case. Those that want to chop down the forests end up being chopped down themselves. However those that grow plants in order to eat, Napoti seems to help in their harvest.
