The first 3 entities to appear of the destruction of the universe, and the architects of [[Lore/History/The Creation\|The Creation]].

--- 

# Details
According to the [[Lore/History/The Creation\|Story of Creation]], these are beings beyond the scope of Gods and the creators of the universe and everything in it. Of interest, it is said that rather than making the universe from nothing, they appeared after the destruction of "The Universe", implying some sort of Universal Cycle.

They are a trio of primal beings based on the fundamental building blocks of the universe: Energy and Entropy, with the third's domain being unclear.

It is also worth nothing that, while we have some idea of the fates of Mitomar and Mikasu, Maynel's fate is never disclosed.


# Descriptions

## Mitomar
God of Energy and one of the three [[Characters/Gods/Primal Entities\|Primal Entities]]. According to the [[Lore/History/The Creation\|Story of Creation]], he split himself into pieces in order to release energy into the universe and bring the creations of [[Characters/Gods/Primal Entities#Mikasu\|Mikasu]] to life. It is unclear if this killed him, or if he still exists in some capacity.

## Mikasu
One of the three [[Characters/Gods/Primal Entities\|Primal Entities]], that holds power over an unknown domain. According to the[[Lore/History/The Creation\| Story of Creation]], she created the [[Characters/Gods/Seven Lights\|Seven Lights]], and then made herself into [[Locations/The Home\|The Home]], a place where her creations could be safe from her brother [[Characters/Gods/Primal Entities#Maynel\|Maynel]]. It is unclear if this action kills her, or if she lives on as [[Locations/The Home\|The Home]].

## Maynel
God of Entropy and one of the three [[Characters/Gods/Primal Entities\|Primal Entities]]. According to the [[Lore/History/The Creation\|Story of Creation]], he has a disdain for existence and strives to return all of reality to a state of nothingness. It is theorized that he may be the "something" that called to [[Characters/Gods/Seven Lights#Mainell\|Mainell]] from outside [[Locations/The Home\|Home]].
