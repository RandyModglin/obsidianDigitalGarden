# Details
Unlike the other members of the [[Characters/Gods/Seven Lights\|Seven Lights]], [[Characters/Gods/Seven Lights#Tarime\|Seven Lights#Tarime]] never got the chance to create gods, or even claim a domain, but that doesn’t mean his divinity hasn’t lived on. In [[Locations/The Home\|Home]]‘s history, three humans have ascended to godhood, now known as the 3 Hopes.

# Description

## Mylon
The God of Warriors and one of the [[Characters/Gods/Three Hopes\|Three Hopes]], he was the first mortal to achieve godhood. This was a long and arduous journey, though we have no details at the moment of how he achieved such a feat. 

We do known that he wishes to produce the best warriors in preparation for the upcoming battle, though we don’t know exactly what battle he’s preparing for.

## Delon
The Self Created God and one of the [[Characters/Gods/Three Hopes\|Three Hopes]], he is a mortal that stumbled into godhood, not even he knows how he managed it. Even know he seeks to figure out how he ascended to godhood.

## Fred
The Immortal and one of the [[Characters/Gods/Three Hopes\|Three Hopes]], is a mortal who’s [[Glossaries/Lore Glossary#Light\|Soul]] refused to leave his [[Glossaries/Lore Glossary#Crystal\|Lore Glossary#Crystal]] after he was killed. When [[Characters/Gods/Domain Gods/Life Domain Gods#Hymm\|Life Domain Gods#Hymm]] came to claim his soul, Fred fought the Hand of Death, his [[Glossaries/Lore Glossary#Light\|Soul]] only growing into a powerful bright light as their fight raged on.

While he lacks any of the powers of the other divine, Fred contains the only know [[Glossaries/Lore Glossary#Light\|Soul]] to exhibit his immortal behavior. While many of the other gods pick on Fred for his weakness, he’s always quick to challenge to his doubters “Come and Kill Me”.
