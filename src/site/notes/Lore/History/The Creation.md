# The Story
No one knows what happened before The Creation, But after the destruction of the universe, 3 entities appeared, [[Characters/Gods/Primal Entities#Mitomar\|Mitomar]], [[Characters/Gods/Primal Entities#Mikasu\|Mikasu]], and [[Characters/Gods/Primal Entities#Maynel\|Maynel]]. These 3 entities looked upon the remains and divided it amongst each other. [[Characters/Gods/Primal Entities#Mitomar\|Mitomar]] took the energy and made it his, vowing to have all things rely on him. [[Characters/Gods/Primal Entities#Mikasu\|Mikasu]] took the remnants of those who have died and made them hers promising new life to inhabit. [[Characters/Gods/Primal Entities#Maynel\|Maynel]] looked upon the endless nothing, he pledged to lead everything into the sanctity of nothing. 

[[Characters/Gods/Primal Entities#Mikasu\|Mikasu]], created [[Characters/Gods/Seven Lights\|7 Lights]] made from remnants of creation. However these creations were frozen, lifeless, unable to move and thus [[Characters/Gods/Primal Entities#Mitomar\|Mitomar]] split himself to release energy into the vast darkness and soon [[Glossaries/Lore Glossary#Light\|Lights]] began to move. [[Characters/Gods/Primal Entities#Maynel\|Maynel]], disgusted by his siblings actions, started to siphon energy in order to turn off the blinding lights. [[Characters/Gods/Primal Entities#Mikasu\|Mikasu]], in order to protect the beautiful [[Characters/Gods/Seven Lights\|Lights]] she created, encased them in crystals and made herself into [[Locations/The Home\|a home]] for the lights to shine bright in. 

The [[Characters/Gods/Seven Lights\|Seven Lights]]; [[Characters/Gods/Seven Lights#Lihit\|Lihit]], [[Characters/Gods/Seven Lights#Mitasa\|Mitasa]], [[Characters/Gods/Seven Lights#Gria\|Gria]], [[Characters/Gods/Seven Lights#Hoyi\|Hoyi]], [[Characters/Gods/Seven Lights#Mori\|Mori]], [[Characters/Gods/Seven Lights#Tarime\|Tarime]], and [[Characters/Gods/Seven Lights#Mainell\|Mainell]], started to explore the lands they lived in. [[Characters/Gods/Seven Lights#Lihit\|Lihit]], the first, made the waters and claimed it as hers. [[Characters/Gods/Seven Lights#Mitasa\|Mitasa]] produced luminous and claimed it as his. [[Characters/Gods/Seven Lights#Gria\|Gria]] made the ground and claimed it as hers. [[Characters/Gods/Seven Lights#Hoyi\|Hoyi]] produced the heat and claimed it as his. [[Characters/Gods/Seven Lights#Mori\|Mori]] broke [[Characters/Gods/Seven Lights#Tarime\|Tarime]] and claimed the [[Glossaries/Lore Glossary#Light\|Light]] within as hers. [[Characters/Gods/Seven Lights#Mainell\|Mainell]], claimed nothing as he wanted to share in the bounties of his siblings. 

Over the years many of the [[Characters/Gods/Seven Lights\|lights]] went to work adjusting their creations and working with others to improve upon them. However [[Characters/Gods/Seven Lights#Mainell\|Mainell]] heard something call to him from beyond [[Locations/The Home\|The Home]] and decided to depart in order to explore. Suddenly the endless darkness outside the home snuffed out the [[Glossaries/Lore Glossary#Light\|light]] inside [[Characters/Gods/Seven Lights#Mainell\|Mainell]]. Terrified by the horrors of the dark, the [[Characters/Gods/Seven Lights\|lights]] came to one conclusion, stay in [[Locations/The Home\|The Home]], make more [[Glossaries/Lore Glossary#Light\|lights]] and someday take on the darkness outside. 

[[Characters/Gods/Seven Lights#Lihit\|Lihit]], [[Characters/Gods/Seven Lights#Mitasa\|Mitasa]], [[Characters/Gods/Seven Lights#Gria\|Gria]], and [[Characters/Gods/Seven Lights#Hoyi\|Hoyi]] argued long and hard about how to make more [[Glossaries/Lore Glossary#Light\|Light]]. However, [[Characters/Gods/Seven Lights#Mori\|Mori]] was discussing how to make [[Glossaries/Lore Glossary#Light\|Lights]] with a [[Characters/Gods/The Nine\|voice from beyond The Home]]. She let the voice in and it told her how to make more [[Glossaries/Lore Glossary#Light\|Light]]. But then this [[Characters/Gods/The Nine\|voice]] separated into 9 and spread themselves across [[Locations/The Home\|The Home]] promising to brighten the future lights before dispersing. [[Characters/Gods/Seven Lights#Mori\|Mori]] used the information she had learned and took [[Characters/Gods/Seven Lights#Tarime\|the light]] she claimed, Splitting it to make smaller [[Glossaries/Lore Glossary#Light\|Lights]] and spreading them across [[Locations/The Home\|the lands]] her siblings made.
