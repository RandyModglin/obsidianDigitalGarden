# Story
Legends say [[Characters/Gods/Seven Lights#Mori\|Seven Lights#Mori]] had given birth to a Daughter, [[Characters/Gods/Other Gods#Aurora\|Other Gods#Aurora]]. It is said, [[Characters/Gods/Other Gods#Aurora\|Other Gods#Aurora]] had looked upon the mortals with awe and admiration. So one night she had left to live among them and do as they did. 

[[Characters/Gods/Other Gods#Aurora\|Other Gods#Aurora]] figured that if she truly loved mortals than she should experience the worst amongst them landing her in [[Delva\|Delva]]. [[Delva\|Delva]] was a town with little to no renown and was largely cut off from the world. The people in this town were despicable, murder rape and slavery plagued the town. 

After selling off the body of a [[Dragons\|Dragon]], [[Characters/Gods/Other Gods#Aurora\|Other Gods#Aurora]] bought a slave and decided to free him, However he had nowhere to go so he stayed with her. Over time [[Characters/Gods/Other Gods#Aurora\|Other Gods#Aurora]] came to love the former slave. They had produced a pair of twins, [[Alexia and Amber\|Alexia and Amber]]. 

One night when the man left home to get [[Characters/Gods/Other Gods#Aurora\|Other Gods#Aurora]] a gift, he was murdered. Upon discovering his body, she broke down in tears knowing her mother already had already collected his soul. Rage filled [[Characters/Gods/Other Gods#Aurora\|Other Gods#Aurora]]’s heart, but she couldn’t just wipe these mortals off the map, what example would that show their daughter. So instead she vowed to change the town of [[Delva\|Delva]] to be better and a place her daughters could live. 

After the next few years [[Characters/Gods/Other Gods#Aurora\|Other Gods#Aurora]] ended slavery, murderers were imprisoned or killed, and rapists were disembodied. As the town was cleaned up it grew and grew and as it grew the people began to follow [[Characters/Gods/Other Gods#Aurora\|Other Gods#Aurora]] making her a queen. 

When [[Alexia and Amber\|Alexia and Amber]] turned 18, [[Characters/Gods/Other Gods#Aurora\|Other Gods#Aurora]] disappeared. Some say she went back to the heavens to live with her family, while others say she killed herself. Whatever the reason, [[Alexia and Amber\|Alexia and Amber]] ruled over the kingdom of [[Delva\|Delva]], and eventually lead it to become the Empire of humanity.
